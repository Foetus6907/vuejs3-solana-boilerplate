## Made with Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This boilerplate should help get you started developing Solana Web3 application with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The
template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out
the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more. You can either
use the classic [composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/composition-api.html#setup) if you prefer.

### Inspired by:

This project is made has a response to Icesofty who did a Jamstack and open-source
boilerplate [project](https://github.com/Icesofty/nuxt-solana-boilerplate) with NuxtJs and solana Phantom. He said that
it will be cool to have one made with VueJs, so here it is!

Thanks to [Icesofty](https://github.com/Icesofty) for the Inspiration
